> **RSA 2024 CTF with Cloud Village - BotSilverQuest - Azure CTF**

- I created a CTF challenge where participants had to find a flag in a zip backup file stored in Azure Blob Storage. Despite the zip file being deleted, the storage had versioning enabled and it could be recovered

- This challenge highlighted how blob versioning can lead to sensitive data leakage through previous versions of the blob.
