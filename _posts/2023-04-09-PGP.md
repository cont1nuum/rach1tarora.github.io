 > ## Exporting your key

```bash
gpg --armor --export WhatEverNameYouWant
```
<br>

- If you want it instead to save it to a file the following command can instead be entered: 

```bash
gpg --armor --output myPubKey.asc --export WhatEverNameYouWant

gpg --armor -export WhatEverNameYouWant > myPubKey.asc
```
<br>

- To export your private key, you will enter the following command: 

```bash
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys WhatEverNameYouWant
```
To export to a file, use either the "--output" or the ">" character methods outlined above. As a reminder, do not EVER share your private key with anyone. The only time you should be exporting your private key is when creating a back up. 
<br>
> # Importing a Key

```bash
gpg --import path/to/pubkey.asc
```
where pubkey.asc is the file where you saved the public key you want to import. Here's the output you should receive:
```bash
gpg: key (Expunged): public key "Agora One" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
```
<br>

> #####  Fileless method

The Fileless Method To import a key directly, without the use of a file, you can use either the "cat" command, or "echo" along with a pipe character "|" 
Using "cat"

```bash
cat  "" | gpg --import
```
- The output is the same as the other methods: 

```bash
gpg: key 0B701872: public key "Mun Mun Mun " imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
```

> # Signatures and Verification


There are three common scenarios for the use of clearsigning:

-  Establishing PGP key lineage. When your current key is set to expire, you might sign a message containing your new key with your old key.
-  Important announcements from administrators, developers, or vendors.
-  Proving account ownership.


> #### Clearsigning

```bash
gpg -a --export key.asc | gpg --clearsign
```
```bash
cat <<END | gpg --clearsign
```
> #### Verifying Signatures

- What good are signatures if we can't verify them? 

> ###### Good signature

```bash
cat <<END | gpg --verify
```
- output: 
```bash
gpg: Good signature
```

> ###### Bad signature

```bash
cat <<END | gpg --verify
```
- output: 
```bash
gpg: Bad signature
```
