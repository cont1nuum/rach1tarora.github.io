* December was likely my final month in India with family and friends. I deliberately stayed away from the computer, focusing on enjoying activities beyond security concerns. Spending quality time with loved ones was crucial, knowing the upcoming demands of starting my mastersâ€”full of hustle, studying, on-campus activities, job hunting, working out, and cooking for myself, among other things.


* However, pursuing a master's is more than just those responsibilities. I'm stepping into an entirely foreign land where I'm a stranger. 
I plan to relish every moment here, and I'm currently enjoying it. Classes kick off on January 24th, and thankfully, everything is going smoothly. I hope it continues this way. Excited about the opportunities this year holds; it's now or never for me to leave a mark in this industry and make my family/friends proud


* I completed the coursework in CRTP and passed it! That was the only cybersecurity activity I engaged in during December, and I was genuinely pleased with my accomplishment.
